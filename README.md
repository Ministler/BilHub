# BilHub

BilHub is a comprehensive classroom helper for instructors, teaching assistans and students especially designed for classes that include teamwork. <br />
<br />
•There will be 3 user types; Instructor, TA, and Student. <br />
•Instructor users can host lectures, eg: CS 319 SPRING 2021. <br />
•An instructor can assign TA and Student users via a specific code or link. <br />
•Students can form project groups until the deadline. <br />
•Students that want to be in the same group can form pseudogroups. <br />
•Students can review other students' pages to get information. <br />
•Student pages will include students' info and other projects that students conducted, eg: CS 102 SPRING 2019 project that students enrolled in. <br />
•When the project group formation deadline comes, the system will assign groups automatically by satisfying the most possible number of pseudogroups. <br />
•Each group will have a page that includes project name and student names. <br />
•For each group page, TA's can assign assignments to group pages. eg: Report 1 assignment. <br />
•TA can also assign peer grading assignments that students can grade each other for assignments. <br />
•The visibility of those assignments and peer gradings will be decided by TA. Other students can only view those assignments if TA enables them. <br />
•Assignments can be done by uploading files or sharing a GitHub link. <br />
•Users can search for other users' pages to review students' other projects. <br />
•Users can also search for previous semesters' project groups to get information. The visibility of those project pages will be decided by the previous TA users.  <br />
•Each user will have their pages. Their page will include information, projects, and hosted project sections. Any empty section will not be displayed. <br />
